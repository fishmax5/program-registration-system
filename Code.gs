/**
 * ============================================================================
 *  🗓️  CALENDAR & FORM MANAGER  —  Program Registration + Lunch Ordering
 * ============================================================================
 *  Sheets:
 *    - Master_Program_Dashboard : "Today at Each Location" + participation
 *      metrics + the full per-session table, now split into an "Upcoming
 *      Sessions" sub-table and a "Past Sessions" sub-table (see section 7).
 *      The session table no longer carries a Manual_Override column — it's
 *      fully calendar-derived every render (Location/Type_Tag stay
 *      editable dropdowns, but nothing on this table is protected from a
 *      deleted-event triage sweep or a counts recompute anymore). Event_Date
 *      is the first column, and the old separate Month column has been
 *      replaced everywhere by simply color-tinting the Event_Date cell
 *      itself (see getMonthColor()/applyMonthColorTint()).
 *    - Master_Lunch_Dashboard   : "Today's Lunch Needs" (unchanged, always
 *      at the very top) + the full catering schedule, now likewise split
 *      into "Upcoming Lunch Schedule" / "Past Lunch Schedule" sub-tables.
 *      Every row is one date PER LOCATION, so the row itself is tinted by
 *      location (LOCATION_COLOR_MAP / buildLocationRowTintRules()) — except
 *      the month-tinted Event_Date cell and the yellow hand-entry columns,
 *      which keep their own meaning.
 *    - Lunch_and_Event_Registrants : one row per person per session, split
 *      into "Upcoming Registrants" / "Past Registrants" sub-tables. Leads
 *      with Event_Date (like every other date-bearing tab), then Location
 *      and Event so staff never scroll to see which program a row belongs
 *      to, keeps Manual_Override and Order_Ahead_Flag, and trails with
 *      Party_ID (an internal grouping key — see Party_ID/Party_Size below)
 *      as the very last column. Re-ordering a HEADERS array no longer
 *      scrambles data already on the tab: readAllSectionedRows() re-aligns
 *      each row by header NAME (see buildHeaderProjection()).
 *    - Lunch_Schedule           : the day-by-day catering menu, now broken
 *      down PER LOCATION (one row per Event_Date x Location), with a
 *      "Not Serving" Type option — when a form covers a date that's marked
 *      Not Serving for its location, that date is dropped from the lunch
 *      grid entirely (no lunch choice offered) and its label is annotated
 *      "No Lunch Served" wherever it's shown. Also split into
 *      Upcoming/Past sub-tables like every other date-bearing tab.
 *    - Config                   : Meal Buffer Amounts (Location x Hot/Cold
 *      only — "Not Serving" never gets a buffer row) + Order Ahead Time +
 *      an optional Admin Notification Email + Lunch Service by Location +
 *      Automation & Trigger Ownership (the kill switch and the trigger
 *      owner — see the multi-account note below). Unaffected by the
 *      Upcoming/Past split (it's a settings tab, not a per-date log).
 *    - Deleted_Event_Triage     : same Upcoming/Past split + Event_Date
 *      first-column/month-tint treatment as Lunch_and_Event_Registrants.
 *
 *  Notable behaviors:
 *    - All-day calendar events are skipped entirely.
 *    - Calendar-edit triggers are still torn down for the duration of every
 *      FULL syncCalendars() run and rebuilt immediately after (that sync
 *      itself edits calendar descriptions and would otherwise risk
 *      re-triggering itself). The trigger handler itself, onCalendarChange(),
 *      no longer always runs a full syncCalendars() though — see below.
 *    - CALENDAR INCREMENTAL SYNC: onCalendarChange() now uses the Calendar
 *      API's incremental-sync-token pattern (Calendar.Events.list with a
 *      saved syncToken) to fetch ONLY what changed since the last check,
 *      and only escalates to a full syncCalendars() reconciliation pass
 *      when that cheap delta actually contains something relevant (a new/
 *      modified/cancelled timed event in our tracked window). This requires
 *      the "Calendar" Advanced Service to be enabled on this Apps Script
 *      project (Editor -> Services -> + Calendar API) — see SETUP below.
 *    - EVENT GRAMMAR — the TITLE is just the program name; every SETTING
 *      lives in the event DESCRIPTION, in brackets:
 *        Title "Yoga Basics"           + description "[Cap: 12]"  -> capped at 12
 *        Title "Yoga Basics"           + description "[Grouped]"  -> one continuous
 *          series with ONE form, instead of a separate form per month
 *        Title "Yoga Basics"           + description "[Monthly]"  -> a form per
 *          calendar month (the default, so this is only ever explicit intent)
 *        description "[Cap: 12, Grouped]" or "[Cap: 12] [Grouped]" -> both
 *        description "[All Locations]"  -> this event's sessions share ONE
 *          form with the same-titled sessions on EVERY other calendar,
 *          instead of one form per location. Composes with the above:
 *          "[Grouped, All Locations]" is one form for the whole series
 *          everywhere; "[Monthly, All Locations]" is one form per month
 *          everywhere. Also spelled [Shared] / [All Sites] / [Combined] /
 *          [Multi-Site]. See SHARED_LOCATION_SCOPE, and the menu action
 *          "🔗 Link Program Across Locations…" which tags every location's
 *          events and moves the sessions already on the dashboard onto one
 *          form in a single step.
 *      [Fixed] and [Regular] are still read as [Grouped] / [Monthly], so no
 *      existing calendar description needs editing — see EVENT_TYPES.
 *      A title is what attendees read on a shared calendar, so scheduling
 *      jargon does not belong there. Brackets left in a TITLE are still
 *      honored as a legacy fallback (and logged) so existing calendars keep
 *      their capacity; see parseSettingsBrackets()/resolveEventSettings().
 *        Title "*Yoga Basics"          -> TENTATIVE. A leading "*" means the
 *          session isn't confirmed: no form is generated and no registry
 *          row is written, until the asterisk comes off. parseEventTitle()
 *          strips the asterisk from cleanTitle, and since computeEventId()
 *          keys off cleanTitle, confirming an event later produces the
 *          SAME Event_ID — it just flows through as a new session with no
 *          reconciliation. (Re-adding an asterisk to an already-confirmed
 *          event does NOT triage it; existing registrations are kept.)
 *          The asterisk is also how a CANCELLED occurrence is marked: an
 *          event named "*NO Tai Chi" stays visible on the calendar for
 *          staff and attendees while generating no form and no dashboard
 *          row.
 *    - THE REGISTRATION LINK injected into each event description is an
 *      HTML ANCHOR, not a raw URL, and carries no visible Form ID. The ID
 *      rides in the href's #fragment — invisible to the reader, ignored by
 *      Forms, still machine-recoverable so a lost form registry can be
 *      rebuilt instead of spawning duplicate forms. See
 *      buildRegistrationLinkLine()/findRegistrationLineInDescription().
 *    - REGISTRATION LINKS ARE PREFILLED with every box checked
 *      (buildPrefilledAllCheckedUrl) so the common "all of us, all dates"
 *      case is read-and-submit and respondents just uncheck exceptions.
 *      Forms has no default-checked grid, so a prefilled response URL is
 *      the only way to do this; it falls back to the plain published URL if
 *      it can't be built. See that function for the one soft edge.
 *    - PER-LOCATION CATERING POLICY (Config -> "🍽️ Lunch Service by
 *      Location") is what keeps the lunch dashboard from filling with blank
 *      rows. Before it existed the only way to say "Zoom never serves lunch"
 *      was a per-date "Not Serving" row for every Zoom date forever, so in
 *      practice those dates read as merely unconfigured — seeded onto the
 *      dashboard AND asked about on forms. The three postures:
 *        Always        lunch unless a date says otherwise (a catering site)
 *        By exception  only dates with a real Hot/Cold row on Lunch_Schedule
 *        Never         no lunch at all — the location never reaches the
 *                      lunch dashboard, and createRegistrationForm() strips
 *                      both lunch questions off its forms entirely
 *      See isLunchOfferedOn(), which is the single place policy and the
 *      per-date override are reconciled.
 *    - THE LUNCH DASHBOARD LISTS EVERY UPCOMING date x location where lunch
 *      is on the table, even at zero registrants, so staff can plan against
 *      (and hand-enter buffers on) dates nobody has signed up for yet. Past
 *      dates are never back-seeded.
 *    - DEMAND ALWAYS WINS over policy. Policy only decides what gets SEEDED;
 *      a date somebody is actually registered to eat on always appears, and
 *      if no Hot/Cold menu backs it, the admin digest says so. That is the
 *      safety net for "By exception" — forgetting a menu row can leave a
 *      date off the plan, but never off the plan once a real person is
 *      expecting to be fed.
 *    - ADMIN NOTIFICATIONS: set an address in Config to get ONE digest per
 *      sync covering only things needing a human — waitlisted registrants,
 *      forms that couldn't be opened, events sent to triage. A sync with
 *      nothing to report sends nothing. Blank address = disabled.
 *    - ONE FORM TEMPLATE, ONE BRANCH POINT. Every group — Grouped or Monthly
 *      — is built from the same template, and "Attendance Mode" is now on
 *      every form:
 *        "Everyone, every date"          -> one checkbox of who eats, applied
 *          to every session date, including dates added to a Grouped series
 *          afterward (see the ALL_DATES registry + applyAllDatesCatchup()).
 *        "Let me pick specific dates/people" -> the two roster grids,
 *          "Who is Attending Each Date?" and "Who Needs Lunch Each Date?",
 *          with dates as ROWS and PERSON_COLUMN_LABELS as COLUMNS. Full
 *          per-person, per-date resolution: any guest can attend/skip/eat
 *          independently of any other. Checking lunch WITHOUT attendance is
 *          not silently dropped — processFormResponse() reconciles it as
 *          attending and flags it in Admin_Notes.
 *      There is NO "how many guests?" question: page 1 has three optional
 *      guest-name fields and the headcount is simply how many were filled
 *      in. That kills two bugs by construction — the old "said 3, named 2,
 *      catered for 2" mismatch, and mis-routing between guest-count branch
 *      pages (Forms silently falls through to the NEXT section when an
 *      explicit after-section jump isn't applied, which is how picking 2
 *      guests could land you on the 3-guest page). The whole form now has
 *      exactly two page breaks and two navigation rules, both to SUBMIT.
 *      A grid column whose guest name was left blank is ignored at parse
 *      time, so the pre-checked columns for guests you didn't bring cost
 *      nothing.
 *    - OUR OWN CALENDAR EDITS MUST NOT COME BACK AS WORK. Removing the
 *      calendar-edit triggers during a sync stops them FIRING, not the
 *      changes accumulating — so re-creating them afterwards handed
 *      onCalendarChange() one queued description write per event, each of
 *      which escalated to a full syncCalendars(). An import of 272 events
 *      became a queue of full syncs. primeCalendarSyncTokens() now advances
 *      each calendar's sync token past our own edits immediately before the
 *      triggers go back on (in syncCalendarsInternal()'s finally, and at the
 *      end of a bootstrap).
 *    - TRIGGERS ARE RESET, NOT PATCHED. writeTriggers() used to add a
 *      trigger only if none existed, which cannot clean up a duplicate once
 *      one is there. The real-world case: Apps Script installable triggers
 *      are private to the Google account that created them, so a second
 *      person running "Check Triggers"/initSheet() from their own login
 *      creates a SECOND, mutually invisible set of calendar-edit triggers —
 *      both then fire on every edit, forever. writeTriggers()/
 *      writeCalendarChangeTriggers() now delete every trigger for a managed
 *      handler THIS ACCOUNT can see and recreate exactly the intended set,
 *      every time — see resetTriggersForHandler(). That fixes same-account
 *      duplication outright; cross-account duplication needs a human to
 *      open the Apps Script editor's Triggers page (which — unlike the
 *      API — lists every trigger regardless of creator) and delete the
 *      other account's copies, and to agree only one account manages
 *      triggers going forward.
 *    - MULTI-ACCOUNT TRIGGER COORDINATION. "Agree only one account manages
 *      triggers" is not something an agreement can enforce, so it is now
 *      enforced in code. Three parts, in Config's "⚙️ Automation & Trigger
 *      Ownership" section and in section 3a:
 *        1. WHERE THE SECOND SET ACTUALLY CAME FROM. It was mostly not
 *           "Check Triggers" — that's admin-gated and rarely pressed.
 *           syncCalendarsInternal() tears the calendar-edit triggers down
 *           and rebuilt them in its `finally`, and syncCalendars() is
 *           deliberately UNGATED (top menu item, used daily by anyone with
 *           edit access). So every "Sync Cal" click by a non-owner removed
 *           nothing and then created a whole set under that account. That
 *           finally is now RESTORE-ONLY: an account that held none before
 *           the sync ends with none.
 *        2. Trigger_Owner records the one account allowed to build
 *           triggers. writeTriggers() and bootstrapCalendars() refuse from
 *           anyone else and name the owner, so an account that cannot see
 *           the triggers at least learns who to ask. Moving it is a
 *           deliberate act (takeOverTriggerOwnership()) that says plainly
 *           it cannot delete the old owner's copies.
 *        3. Automation_Enabled is a kill switch every managed handler reads
 *           first. Script-level state is shared across accounts even though
 *           triggers are not — so this is the only lever that reaches a
 *           trigger you have no power to delete. It cannot remove the
 *           duplicate, but it stops it firing, from any account, without
 *           editor access.
 *      And because all of that is still bookkeeping that can be bypassed by
 *      running a function straight from the script editor, recordHandlerRun()
 *      stamps who each handler ACTUALLY ran as (an installable trigger runs
 *      as its creator). Two accounts seen firing one handler is duplicate
 *      sets, observed rather than inferred — "Admin → Trigger Status" shows
 *      that next to what this account can see and what Config claims, and it
 *      is the disagreement between the three that identifies the problem.
 *    - TRIAGE DISTRUSTS ITSELF. triageDeletedSessions() is the only thing
 *      that removes sessions, and "the calendar didn't come back" used to
 *      read identically to "every session was deleted." It now ignores
 *      calendars it could not READ, ignores rows it cannot attribute to one
 *      it did read, refuses any sweep that would take out most of the table
 *      (TRIAGE_MAX_SESSIONS_PER_RUN / TRIAGE_MAX_FRACTION_PER_RUN, overridden
 *      once by confirmLargeTriage()), and stands down entirely while a
 *      bootstrap import is writing the table. restoreTriagedRegistrants()
 *      puts rows back if a sweep did fire wrongly — necessary because the
 *      import only reads responses newer than the last sync, so a triaged
 *      registrant exists nowhere else.
 *    - THE FIRST IMPORT IS A SLICED JOB, NOT A SYNC. syncCalendars() is cheap
 *      only because it normally has nothing to do. Importing a real calendar
 *      from scratch — a form per program, a description write per event —
 *      does not fit in one six-minute execution, and a timeout there is
 *      destructive: no `finally` runs, so the calendar triggers stay removed
 *      and the persistent form registry never gets flushed (which duplicates
 *      forms on the next attempt). bootstrapCalendars() (section 4b) pauses
 *      every trigger, imports in budgeted slices that hand off to each other
 *      via one-off triggers, and rebuilds the triggers only when it's done.
 *      syncCalendars()/syncRegistrations() stand down while it runs, and
 *      writeTriggers() refuses to put the paused ones back until it
 *      finishes — a pause is only as good as the paths that can undo it, and
 *      an import that spans half an hour gives "Check Triggers" plenty of
 *      chances. Each slice re-asserts the pause as well.
 *    - LIVE FORMS ARE MIGRATED, NOT JUST THE TEMPLATE. A group's form is
 *      created once and reused for as long as the group runs, so bumping
 *      TEMPLATE_VERSION only ever fixed forms created afterward — everyone
 *      filling in an existing form still met the old questions (and the old
 *      mis-routing). migrateFormsToCurrentTemplate(), which runs at the end
 *      of every syncRegistrations() import, rebuilds any form still on an
 *      older template IN PLACE, keeping its Form ID so every link, registry
 *      entry and calendar description stays valid. Forms already on the
 *      current template are stamped and thereafter skipped without an API
 *      call. Run recheckAllRegistrationForms() from the editor to force a
 *      re-check (e.g. after hand-editing a form).
 *    - NO LUNCH MEANS NO LUNCH QUESTION. The lunch grid only ever lists
 *      dates that actually serve lunch (buildDateLabelSets()), and when NO
 *      date on a form does — or the location never caters —
 *      syncLunchQuestionsOnForm() takes both lunch questions off the form
 *      entirely and says so in the description. They come back on their own
 *      if a catered date later appears. On the data side buildRegistrantRow()
 *      gates lunch demand on isLunchOfferedOn(), so the "everyone, every
 *      date" branch's single who-eats answer can't book a meal on a
 *      Not-Serving date.
 *    - The template calls setCollectEmail(true) and
 *      setAllowResponseEdits(true) — a submitter's email becomes a real
 *      identity key, Google auto-sends a receipt with an edit link, and
 *      Form_Source on Lunch_and_Event_Registrants links straight to that
 *      person's own submission (response.getEditResponseUrl()) instead of
 *      to the shared form editor.
 *    - Allergies / dietary needs is its own required-free text field,
 *      separate from the free-text "Anything Else?" catch-all — previously
 *      a single "Footer Note" paragraph item did double duty as both
 *      display text and the admin-notes scan target. The per-location
 *      note itself is now a non-input SectionHeaderItem.
 *    - Party_ID (= the Google Form response ID) and Party_Size (headcount
 *      including the registrant) are stamped on every row from the same
 *      submission, so staff can see "party of 3, one no-show" at a glance
 *      on Lunch_and_Event_Registrants.
 *    - Name-based identity (dedup / manual-edit protection / the "sign up
 *      for all dates" registry) is matched case/whitespace-insensitively
 *      via normalizeNameKey() — "Jane Smith" and "jane smith " are the same
 *      person. The Name column itself still displays exactly as typed.
 *    - RESUBMISSIONS ARE APPLIED, NOT DROPPED: buildRegistrantRow() keys
 *      identity on Event_ID+Name+Person_Type, same as before, but now also
 *      tracks each row's Party_ID (the originating Response ID). A response
 *      re-seen under the SAME Party_ID (an edit via the "edit response"
 *      link — see setAllowResponseEdits(true) above) patches that one row
 *      in place. A DIFFERENT Party_ID for the same identity — a genuinely
 *      new submission — marks the old row Program_Status/Lunch_Status =
 *      'Superseded' (kept, not deleted, with a note in Admin_Notes) and
 *      inserts the new row as the live truth. 'Superseded' rows are
 *      excluded from every active/waitlist count automatically, the same
 *      way 'Cancelled' already was.
 *    - CAPACITY IS VISIBLE ON THE FORM: whenever a capped session hits 0
 *      Remaining_Seats, its date label on both roster grids gets a
 *      CAPACITY_HINT_SUFFIX ("(FULL - Waitlist)") appended — see
 *      buildCapacityHintsFromRegistryRows() / refreshFormCapacityLabelsForAllForms(),
 *      called at the end of every syncRegistrations() once Remaining_Seats
 *      is fresh. Converts silent waitlisting into something a respondent
 *      actually sees before submitting. A plain hyphen is used (not the em
 *      dash meal-hint separator) so stripMealHint() can strip both
 *      unambiguously when matching a grid row back to its Event_ID.
 *    - Template forms are cached forever in Script Properties, keyed by
 *      TEMPLATE_VERSION — bump that constant whenever the template
 *      structure changes so existing cached forms don't silently drift out
 *      of sync with the parser.
 *    - Form descriptions list dates one-per-line.
 *
 *  PERFORMANCE / CACHING CONTRACT (see section 1c):
 *    Everything expensive in a sync is a REMOTE call — a Sheets read, a
 *    FormApp call, a CalendarApp fetch, a Script Properties round trip — so
 *    the optimization work is all about not making the same one twice.
 *      - Per-EXECUTION caches (Apps Script globals, which die with the run,
 *        so there is no cross-run staleness to reason about): the
 *        Lunch_Schedule meal index, Config's meal buffers + order-ahead
 *        days, per-form item lookups, and the calendar event fetch. Each is
 *        dropped by whatever rewrites its source — invalidateMealInfoIndex()
 *        from renderLunchScheduleSheet(), invalidateConfigCaches() from
 *        buildConfigSheet(), invalidateFormItemIndex() from
 *        applyFormDateLabels(), invalidateCalendarEventsCache() from the
 *        calendar-delta handler. ADD A NEW CACHE ONLY WITH ITS INVALIDATOR.
 *      - Batched Script Properties: the form registry, the all-dates
 *        registry, and the form-label fingerprints are read once and written
 *        at most once per run via flushPersistentRegistries(), called as
 *        soon as each dirtying loop finishes rather than at the very end.
 *      - Fingerprinted form writes: applyFormDateLabels() hashes the labels
 *        it is about to write and skips the entire FormApp round trip when
 *        they match what this script last wrote to that form. Since the
 *        hourly capacity-label refresh normally has nothing to change, the
 *        common case costs zero Forms calls. The fingerprint only tracks
 *        THIS script's writes — a hand-edited form is not detected until
 *        the labels legitimately change again (pass { force: true }).
 *      - Rows already in memory are threaded, not re-read: syncRegistrations()
 *        reads each tab once and hands the rows to the count recompute, the
 *        dashboard render, and the lunch rollup. renderProgramDashboard()
 *        reports registrantsMoved back so a caller knows when its copy went
 *        stale under a triage sweep.
 *    Bulk sheet WRITES were already batched (one setValues/setBackgrounds/
 *    setFormulas per block, never a per-cell loop) — keep it that way.
 *
 *  SETUP:
 *    1. Update CALENDAR_MAP below with your real Calendar IDs -> locations.
 *    2. In the Apps Script editor: Services (+) -> add "Google Calendar API"
 *       (the Advanced Service — this is required for the incremental
 *       calendar-edit sync in section 3b; without it, onCalendarChange()
 *       will fail with "Calendar is not defined").
 *    3. Run initSheet() once (from the editor) to build all tabs, formatting,
 *       AND the triggers.
 *    4. Fill in the Lunch_Schedule tab (now one row per date PER LOCATION)
 *       and Config's Meal Buffer Amounts + Order Ahead Time.
 *    5. Reload the sheet to see the "🗓️ Calendar & Form Manager" menu.
 *    6. FIRST IMPORT: use "Import Everything (First Run)" in that menu
 *       (bootstrapCalendars()), NOT "Sync Cal". The first import has to
 *       build a form for every program on every calendar, which is far more
 *       than one Apps Script execution can do — the bootstrap slices it
 *       across as many runs as it takes and pauses every trigger until it's
 *       finished. See section 4b. initializeAndSyncAll() does steps 3 and 6
 *       in one go.

 * WHEN sessions share a form ([Grouped] = the whole series, [Monthly] = a
 * month at a time). WHERE was fixed — the group key started with the calendar
 * ID, so the same program running at Narberth and at Ashbridge always got two
 * separate forms, even when it is one program with one roster that simply
 * meets in two rooms.
 *
 * `[All Locations]` in an event's DESCRIPTION opens up the second dimension:
 * that event's sessions pool with the same-titled sessions on EVERY other
 * program calendar, onto one form. It composes with the existing tags rather
 * than replacing them —
 *
 *   [Grouped, All Locations]  one form for the whole series, everywhere
 *   [Monthly, All Locations]  one form per calendar month, everywhere
 *   [Cap: 12, All Locations]  ...and the cap still applies PER SESSION
 *
 * — because it only changes the SCOPE half of the group key
 * (SHARED_LOCATION_SCOPE in place of the calendar ID; see buildEventGroups()).
 *
 * The tag is read per EVENT, exactly like [Cap: N] and [Grouped]: an event
 * that carries it joins the shared form, one that doesn't keeps its own
 * per-location form. That makes a half-tagged program a describable state
 * rather than an ambiguous one — and since it is nearly always a mistake,
 * warnAboutPartiallySharedPrograms() says so out loud.
 *
 * WHAT A SHARED FORM HAS TO DO DIFFERENTLY. Its dates are no longer all at
 * one place, so:
 *   - every date label names its location (formatSessionLabel()), which is
 *     also what keeps two locations' sessions on the SAME day from collapsing
 *     into one grid row or one registry-index key;
 *   - lunch is decided per date+location as it always was (isLunchOfferedOn),
 *     so a Never-catering location's dates simply never reach the lunch grid,
 *     and the lunch questions come off only when NO location on the form
 *     caters;
 *   - the footer note and the form description list every location involved.
 * Everything downstream — Event_IDs, registrant rows, counts, the lunch
 * dashboard — is already keyed per session, and a session still knows exactly
 * one location. Nothing there had to learn about sharing.

// AUTOMATION KILL SWITCH + TRIGGER OWNERSHIP  (Config -> "⚙️ Automation & Trigger Ownership")
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// THE PROBLEM THESE EXIST FOR. Apps Script installable triggers are private
// to the Google account that created them. ScriptApp.getProjectTriggers()
// returns only what the CURRENTLY RUNNING account can see, and
// ScriptApp.deleteTrigger() can only delete those. So when two accounts have
// each run "Check Triggers", both own a full set, both sets fire, and
// NEITHER account can see or remove the other's from code. writeTriggers()
// documents this at length; resetTriggersForHandler() fixes it only within
// one account.
//
// What IS shared across every account on this project: Script Properties,
// and this spreadsheet. That asymmetry is the whole design here — no account
// can DELETE another's trigger, but every account can write state that the
// other account's trigger will read and obey when it fires.
//
//   Automation_Enabled    A kill switch any account can flip. Every managed
//                         handler reads it as its first act and returns
//                         immediately when it's "No". You still cannot delete
//                         a trigger you can't see — but you can make it a
//                         no-op from your own login, without editor access.
//   Trigger_Owner         The one account that is supposed to hold the
//                         triggers. writeTriggers() refuses to run from any
//                         other account, which is what stops a SECOND
//                         invisible set from ever being created. The admin
//                         list (AUTHORIZED_ADMIN_EMAILS) holds more than one
//                         account on purpose; this narrows trigger creation
//                         to exactly one at a time without shrinking it.
//   Triggers_Verified_At  When that owner last rebuilt them, so "is this
//                         claim stale?" is answerable.

 * applied, Forms silently falls through to the NEXT section in document
 * order, which is how picking 2 guests could land you on the 3-guest page.
 * Dropping the guest-count question removes seven of the eight jumps and
 * makes that entire class of mis-routing impossible rather than merely
 * fixed. It also removes the old "picked 3 guests, typed 2 names, catered
 * for 2" mismatch, since the names ARE the headcount.
 *
 * IMPORTANT ordering note: in Apps Script Forms, a page's contents are
 * whatever items were added between ITS PageBreakItem and the NEXT one —

//     once per form, on every sync.
//   - getMealBufferConfigForLocation()/getOrderAheadDays() re-read Config
//     per call, the former once per lunch-dashboard rollup row.
//   - form.getItems() is a REMOTE call and getResponseValueByTitle() made
//     one per lookup — roughly ten per response, times every response.
//   - CalendarApp.getEvents() ran once per calendar in syncCalendarsInternal()

 *
 * Google Forms has no notion of a default-checked grid, so the only way to
 * do this is a prefilled response URL; that URL is what we hand out as the
 * registration link (calendar descriptions, the dashboard's "View Live
 * Form"). It has to be regenerated whenever the grid rows change, which is

 *
 * Entries are emitted for BOTH branches' items at once — the two roster
 * grids and the all-dates who-eats checkbox. Forms simply ignores the
 * parameters for a page a given respondent never visits, so one URL covers
 * whichever branch they pick.
 *
 * KNOWN SOFT EDGE: a prefill value only matches a row whose label is still
 * byte-identical, so after refreshFormCapacityLabelsForAllForms() appends a
 * "(FULL - Waitlist)" hint to a date, the already-published link stops
 * pre-checking THAT date until the link is regenerated (next time the form
 * gains/loses dates). The same applies to a link published before
 * migrateFormsToCurrentTemplate() rebuilt its form, since the entry IDs
 * themselves change. Every other date still pre-checks, and a full sign-up
 * is never wrong — just one box short of pre-filled. Regenerating on every
 * capacity change would mean rewriting every calendar description on every
 * sync, which costs far more than it saves.
 *
 * Returns null on any failure — callers fall back to the plain published
 * URL, which is the pre-existing behavior and always works.

//   1. re-rendered and RE-SORTED the whole tab — so the half-finished row you
//      were typing jumped somewhere else mid-entry; and
//   2. threw up a modal asking whether to rewrite every live registration
//      form covering that date.
// Neither is survivable while entering a month of menus, and there was no
// blank row to type into in the first place: the Upcoming table ends exactly
// where its last dated row does, so adding one meant inserting a row by hand
// first. That whole arrangement is gone.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOW. The tab ends with an ADD block — a banner, a header, and
// open space to the bottom of the sheet. Put CSV there, however much of it:
//
//     2026-09-14, Narberth, Hot, Chicken Parmesan, Chx Parm
//     2026-09-15, Ashbridge, Cold, Turkey Wrap, Turkey
//     2026-09-16, Narberth, Not Serving
//
// as a normal multi-column paste (from Excel/Sheets), as raw comma-separated
// text (one cell per line, or one cell holding every line), or typed a row at
// a time. All of it lands in the same parser, so ONE row and TWO HUNDRED rows
// behave identically — the only difference is how long the toast takes.
// Complete rows are folded into the schedule and the block is emptied ready
// for the next batch; anything unparseable stays put with a reason, so a bad
// date in row 40 never silently swallows a good row 41.
//
// Pushing the menu out to live forms is now an EXPLICIT act — the
// "🍱 Push Menu Changes to Forms" menu item — rather than a modal that
// interrupts typing. The daily Sync Cal picks it up regardless.

 *     Lunch_Schedule              — including the new ADD block
 *     Master_Lunch_Dashboard      — recomputed; hand-entered columns kept
 *     Member_Roll / Program_Options — staff columns never touched
 *     Tab order, column widths, dropdowns, conditional formatting
 *
 *   NOT TOUCHED
 *     The calendars.       Nothing is read from or written to them.
 *     The registration forms. No form is opened, created, or relabelled.
 *     The triggers.        Automation keeps running exactly as it was.
 *     The template form.   Not created or version-checked.
 *
 * EVERY ROW IS READ BEFORE ANY TAB IS CLEARED. Each render is otherwise a

/**
 * Ensures the triggers this project depends on exist, WITH NO DUPLICATES —
 *  - Two time-driven triggers (daily calendar sync, hourly registration sync)
 *  - One calendar-update trigger per calendar in CALENDAR_MAP, so an edit
 *    made directly on a calendar kicks off onCalendarChange() (which now
 *    does a cheap incremental check before deciding whether a full
 *    syncCalendars() is actually warranted — see section 3b).
 *
 * A FULL RESET, not an add-if-missing: every trigger for a handler this
 * project manages is deleted first, then exactly the intended set is
 * created. See resetTriggersForHandler(). This is what makes it safe to
 * press "Check Triggers" as often as you like — it can never leave two
 * copies of the same trigger both firing, however many were sitting there
 * before, and whatever left them there.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THIS CANNOT FIX: Apps Script installable triggers are
 * private to the Google account that created them — ScriptApp.getProjectTriggers()
 * only ever returns the triggers the CURRENTLY RUNNING account can see, never
 * another account's. If two different people have each run "Check Triggers"
 * / initSheet() / Import Everything on this project from their own Google
 * logins, each created their OWN calendar-edit triggers, invisible to each
 * other — so both fire on every calendar edit, independently, forever,
 * and no run of this function (from either account) can see or remove the
 * other's copies. That is what actually caused the extra calendar triggers
 * this comment is here because of.
 *   FIX: only ever run setup/trigger functions (this one, initSheet(),
 *   bootstrapCalendars(), the "Check Triggers"/"Import Everything" menu
 *   items) from ONE Google account — ideally whichever one owns the
 *   spreadsheet. To find and remove another account's leftover triggers,
 *   open the Apps Script editor's Triggers page (clock icon in the left
 *   sidebar) — unlike the API, that page lists every trigger on the
 *   project regardless of which account created it, with a "Created by"
 *   column, and anyone with edit access can delete from there.
 *
 * DECLINES while a bootstrap import is in flight, because that import
 * deliberately took these triggers down (see pauseAutomationForBootstrap()).
 * This is the guard that matters: the pause is only as good as the places
 * that can undo it, and "Check Triggers" — pressed by someone watching a long
 * import and wondering why nothing is scheduled — is exactly the reflex that
 * would put a hundred queued calendar edits back in play mid-run. Only
 * finishBootstrap() passes force, restoring everything when the import is
 * genuinely done.

// ============================================================================
// 4b. LARGE-SETUP BOOTSTRAP  (bootstrapCalendars / resumeBootstrapCalendars)
// ============================================================================
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: a normal syncCalendars() finishes in seconds because it has
// almost nothing to do — every group already has its form and its rows, so it
// skips them. The FIRST import is the opposite: every group is new, and each
// one costs a Drive copy, a dozen-plus Forms calls, a sheet write and one
// calendar-description write PER EVENT. Multiply that by a full 60-day window
// of programs across three calendars and it blows straight through Apps
// Script's six-minute execution limit — which is exactly what happens when
// you run initSheet() and then Sync Cal on a real calendar.
//
// A timeout there is worse than slow. The kill is not an exception, so
// syncCalendarsInternal()'s `finally` never runs: the calendar-edit triggers
// it removed at the start stay removed, the persistent registries never get
// flushed (so the forms it just created are forgotten and DUPLICATED on the
// next attempt), and whatever it managed to write is half-applied.
//
// So the bootstrap works in slices:
//   - Automation is paused up front — the calendar-edit triggers AND the
//     time-driven syncCalendars/syncRegistrations triggers — so nothing else
//     runs while a multi-execution import is in flight. syncCalendars() also
//     refuses to start on its own while the bootstrap is active.
//   - Each slice imports whole groups until its time budget runs out, then
//     hands off to the next slice via a one-off trigger. Progress lives in
//     the SHEET (a group with rows is skipped next time), so a slice never
//     has to trust anything it kept in memory.
//   - The hand-off trigger is armed BEFORE the work starts, timed to fire
//     after this slice's budget. If a slice is killed anyway, the next one
//     still comes. A slice that finishes normally re-arms it for a minute
//     out, so the common case doesn't idle.
//   - The final slice rebuilds every trigger, renders the dashboard once,
//     and clears the state.

 * ADMIN ACTION — "🔗 Rewrite Event Links".
 *
 * Walks every UPCOMING event on every calendar, strips out every registration
 * link it can find (all formats, all duplicates), and then writes back exactly
 * one — or none — according to Config's "Registration Link in Events" setting.
 * The link always goes at the TOP of the description; everything else in the
 * description keeps its content and its order.
 *
 * ONLY UPCOMING EVENTS. A past event's description is a record of what people
 * were sent, and rewriting it changes nothing anyone will act on while
 * spending quota and — worse — generating a calendar notification for an event
 * that has already happened.
 *
 * The form for each event comes from the SESSION TABLE (Event_ID -> Form_ID),
 * not from the description being replaced. That's the point: the description
 * is the thing that is wrong, so it can't also be the source of truth for
 * what should replace it.
 *
 * CALENDAR-EDIT TRIGGERS ARE TAKEN DOWN FOR THE DURATION, exactly as
 * syncCalendarsInternal() does, and rebuilt in a `finally` so they come back
 * whether this succeeds or throws. This function's entire job is editing the
 * description of every upcoming event, and every one of those edits is a
 * calendar update — with the triggers live, a run over a few hundred events
 * queues a few hundred onCalendarChange executions, each of which can decide a
 * full syncCalendars() is warranted. That is the trigger storm this codebase
 * has been bitten by before; a cleanup pass is the single most efficient way
 * to cause it.
 *
 * primeCalendarSyncTokens() then swallows this run's own edits BEFORE the
 * triggers go back on, so the first delta check after the restore doesn't see
 * every event we just touched and start a sync anyway.

// ============================================================================
// OLD MONTHS
// ============================================================================
//
// Every date-sorted tab in this workbook grows in one direction forever. A
// year in, the Past section of Lunch_and_Event_Registrants is thousands of
// rows that nobody scrolls through and every render rewrites.
//
// THE CHEAP HALF OF THE PROBLEM — that it is in the way — is solved here, by
// HIDING past rows older than PAST_MONTHS_SHOWN months. Hiding, specifically:
//
//   • Nothing is moved and nothing is deleted, so no sync, count, dashboard
//     rollup or Member_Roll recompute sees any difference. That matters more
//     than it sounds: the rows on these tabs ARE the database, and a scheme
//     that relocates them has to be right about every reader of every tab.
//   • Ctrl+F still finds a hidden row. Someone asking "was Marion here last
//     March?" gets an answer, without the tab opening onto last March.
//   • It is one API call to undo (showAllPastRows(), on the menu).
//
// THE EXPENSIVE HALF — that the rows still cost render time and cells — is
// NOT solved here, deliberately. See reportArchivableMonths(), which measures
// it and says what the options are, and the "Old months" section of
// USER_GUIDE.md, which lays out the archive designs and why none of them is
// worth doing before the numbers say so.

// ============================================================================
//
// Everything else in this workbook is derived: wipe it, re-sync, and it comes
// back. These two tabs are the exception — they're where the ORGANIZATION'S
// OWN knowledge accumulates, the things no calendar event or form response can
// tell you. "Marion always brings her sister." "This program needs the big
// room." "Cold lunch only, no dairy."
//
// Each tab is therefore split down the middle:
//   LEFT  — recomputed from the registrant/session history every refresh.
//           Never hand-edit; it will be overwritten.
//   RIGHT — MEMBER_ROLL_STAFF_COLUMNS / PROGRAM_OPTIONS_STAFF_COLUMNS. Written
//           only by people, never by this script. Keyed by Name (or
//           Event+Location), so a row keeps its notes as long as the key is
//           stable — and normalizeNameKey() makes the key survive the casing
//           and spacing drift that "Jane Smith" vs "jane smith " produces
//           across separate form submissions.
//
// This is also what the Quick Mark dropdowns are built from — the unique
// people and programs, deduplicated once here rather than re-derived on every
// keystroke.

// 6e. LEGACY TAB MERGE  (mergeLegacyTabs / previewLegacyTabMerge)
// ============================================================================
//
// Layout changes inside a tab need no help: readAllSectionedRows() re-aligns
// rows by header NAME, so re-ordering or adding a column is invisible (see
// buildHeaderProjection()). What DOES get stranded is data sitting in a tab
// under a different NAME —
//
//   • Active_Programs            an early version of the session table
//   • Lunch_Schedule_OLD_<date>  renamed by initLunchScheduleSheet() when it
//                               found the old Month-based menu layout
//   • Config_OLD_<date>          same, for Config
//   • "Copy of …", "… (old)"     anything made by hand while troubleshooting
//
// — which is invisible to every sync and quietly rots. Worse,
// initSheet() used to DELETE Active_Programs outright without reading it.
//
// So this identifies those tabs BY CONTENT (how well their header row matches
// each canonical layout, not by guessing at names), merges their rows into the
// right current tab, and only then deletes them.
//
// MERGE RULE: existing rows win. A legacy row is added only when its identity
// key isn't already present, so re-running is idempotent and nothing current is
// ever overwritten by something older. Every merged row is stamped in
// Admin_Notes/Triage_Notes where the tab has such a column, so its provenance
// is visible afterwards.

/**
 * Removes the schedule rows for upcoming dates that Lunch_Schedule now marks
 * "Not Serving".
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NEEDED AT ALL: the Full Schedule table is UPSERTED, not rebuilt.
 * That's deliberate — it's what makes hand-entered buffers and actuals survive
 * every sync — but it also means a row, once written, never leaves on its own.
 * So closing the kitchen on a date the dashboard had already picked up left
 * the row sitting there with its old count, indefinitely, and the ordering
 * number stayed on the screen the kitchen orders from.
 *
 * Three things are deliberately NOT dropped:
 *
 *   PAST DATES. Those rows hold Actual_Ordered / Total_Consumed / Thrown_Away —
 *   a record of what really happened. Marking an old date "Not Serving" is
 *   almost always a correction to the plan, and it must not erase the receipt.
 *
 *   HAND-EDITED ROWS (Manually Added / Manually Edited). Everything else in
 *   this workbook treats those as untouchable; an exception here would be the
 *   one place a person's own row disappears under them. Reported instead.
 *
 *   ROWS STILL IN THE ROLLUP. A "Not Serving" day where somebody's
 *   Lunch_Served box is ticked stays, because food demonstrably happened —
 *   Served_Confirmed records reality, not the plan.
